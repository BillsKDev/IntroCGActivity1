What was done:

Today I worked on creating a variety of shaders such as one for multi-UV, multi-UV View Direction, WorldPosDebug, an AllProps, Lambert and a WorldReflection,

Strengths:


Able to get repo and unity project quickly and can easiily understand how to implement
Understood how to debug errors if i had any




Weaknesses:


Struggled with understanding some of the code and how it works
Some of the Shader specific code I was just copying and not fully understanding
Need to improve knowledge on syntax

Opportunities: 


- This assignment allowed me to learn more about how shader specfic code works and what can be accomplished with the use of shaders


**Self Evaluation**
- I would give myself a 28/30 since I completed everything in class and was fully prepared just had small hiccups to complete the task
